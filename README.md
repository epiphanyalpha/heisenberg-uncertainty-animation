# Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: Wave Animation

This Python script creates an animation that illustrates how the Uncertainty Principle arises from wave superposition. It shows:

- A single wave (precise momentum, unknown position)
- 10-wave interference (partial localization)
- 400-wave superposition (localized packet, uncertain momentum)

Built using `matplotlib.animation`, designed for educational/demonstrative purposes.

▶️ To generate the GIF, just run the script in a Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment with `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `pillow`.
